# UShorten
Basic Python URL Shortener

This is a python program working with the Bitly API to provide fast link shortening.

Although it requires a username and password to work correctly, it does not store this information.
It also does not store any links entered OR shortened versions of the original links.

One more thing to keep in mind: Bitly sets an amount of links that can be generated for each account.
The limit for a free account is 1,000 links.

Thanks for using and feel free to suggest changes or improvements.
